2.	 Cookies We Use

2.1.	Type of Cookies

The Services use the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:
Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through the Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of the sites or applications and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have requested cannot be provided. We only use these cookies to provide you with those services.
Functionality Cookies: These cookies allow the Services to remember choices you make when you use a site or application, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details, and remembering the changes you make to other parts of your account or preferences. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use the Services.
Performance Cookies: These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to the services and how Users use the Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to, the websites that referred them, the pages visited, what time of day they visited, whether they have visited before, and other similar information. Segar Taxi uses this information to help operate the services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our services.
We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how the services work. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies
You can find out more about how Google protects your data here: www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html

Targeting Cookies / Advertising Cookies: These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization.
2.2.	Disabling Cookies
Google AdWords Conversion Tool : Privacy information of the provider (https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722022?hl=en), Link to Opt-Out (https://goo.gl/ghZWnt).
2.3.	Pixel Tags
We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on the Services to track the actions of Users on our sites and applications. Unlike cookies, which are stored in the memory of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on web pages you visit. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our Users’ personal data.
2.4.	Do Not Track Signals
